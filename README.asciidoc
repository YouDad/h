== hhighligher (or just h)

A tiny utility to highlight multiple keywords with different colors

- Idea: Paolo Antinori
- Based on: *ack* - http://beyondgrep.com/ written by Andy Lester

=== Description

*h* (hhighlighter is just a name to help search engines) is a really tiny helper script meant to highligt keywords in the output of another linux command:


=== Requirements

*h* is just a tiny facade in front of *ack* so you need to install it first.

*What is ack?*

*ack* is a tool like *grep*, optimized for programmers

Designed for programmers with large heterogeneous trees of source code, ack is written purely in portable Perl 5 and takes advantage of the power of Perl's regular expressions.

see: http://beyondgrep.com/

*ack installation*

*ack* is part of many major linux distributions so you should use your *package manager* to install it.

see: http://beyondgrep.com/install/

If you want to install *ack* in a *portable* way ( at the end ack is just a script ) you do it in this way:

`curl http://beyondgrep.com/ack-2.08-single-file > ~/bin/ack && chmod 0755 !#:3`


=== Installation Instructions

*h* is imlemented as a function in *bash*.

You can install it in one of these ways

- copy and paste `h()` function in you `~/.bashrc`
- configure your `~/.bashrc` to load the external script with `. /path/to/h.sh`

=== Platform Specifics

*h* is currently working only on *bash*. I have plans to turn it compatible with *zsh* and other 1 indexed based arrays shells


=== Usage

*h* is meant to consume the output of another linux command via pipe



`echo "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxywz" | h  a b c d e f g h i j k l`

or

`tail -F | h keyword1 keyword2`

or

`mvn clean install | h FAILURE SUCCESS`
